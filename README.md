Install on RaspberryPi
----
NOT TESTED! COMES WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY!

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev python-setuptools libgstreamer1.0-dev git-core gstreamer1.0-plugins-{bad,base,good,ugly} gstreamer1.0-{omx,alsa} python-dev libmtdev-dev xclip xsel libjpeg-dev

	## Update your update-alternatives to use python3.x instead of raspbian standard version 2.x
	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1
	sudo update-alternatives --config python

	## Be sure to have some more dependencies
	sudo apt install python3-pip git wget curl -y

	## Install pip dependencies:
	python -m pip install --upgrade --user pip setuptools
	python -m pip install --upgrade --user Cython==0.29.10 pillow

	## Install Kivy to Python globally, this might take some time...
	python -m pip install --user kivy
	python -m pip install --user https://github.com/kivy/kivy/archive/master.zip

	## After you have installed Python and Kivy you can get the sources by using Git
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/Satoshi24/Hector9000.git

	## Install all the requirements listed in the file requirements.txt
	cd Hector9000/
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt

	## Done!


The steps below are based on Mama-Hector :

Start Hector :

	hector-start
	
Add Drinks
---

To add a new Drink you have to modify the `drinks.py` file and add a new item into the array

	{
        "name": "NAME OF DRINK",
        "recipe": [
            ("INGREDIENT1", AMOUNT1),
            ("INGREDIENT2", AMOUNT2)
        ]	
    }

All strings in `UPPERCASE` are placeholders, all lowercase strings have to be used literally in the definition. The `INGREDIENTx` names are not cleartext but are identifiers referencing into the `ingredients` list below in the same file. The `AMOUNTx` values are numerical values of the corresponding ingredient's amount in grams.

At the moment there are only some ingredients but feel free to put in some new.

	# "NAME":("NICENAME", ISALCOHOLIC)
	ingredients = {
		"gin": ("Gin", True),
		"rum": ("Rum", True),
		"vodka": ("Vodka", True),
		"tequila": ("Tequila", True),
		"tonic": ("Tonic Water", False),
		"coke": ("Coke", False),
		"oj": ("Orange Juice", False),
		"gren": ("Grenadine", False),
		"mmix": ("Margarita Mix", True)

Here each ingredient identifier is mapped into a tuple containing the NICENAME used in the UI and a flag that tells whether the ingredient contains alcohol.
A future extension might allow multi-language UIs.

Assigning valves
---

So because Hector has twelve valve channels you have 12 valves predefined (in `servo_config.json` and `HectorHardware.py`) to manage the mapping of each ingredient to a valve.
Therefore you have to edit the `servo_config.json` file and set the `value` field to the ingredient identifier you put into the channel. 
Only drinks that have all the required ingredients set in the `servo_config.json` will be shown in the menu.


Example:

	"pump_3": {
		"name": "Pump 3",
		"channel": 2,
		"value": "oj"
	},



Development on non-Hector hardware :
---

If you are not on the "real" Hector hardware you can set the var `devEnvironment` in `Hectorhardware.py` to `True`:

	devEnvironment = True

The HectorHardware library will then emulate Hector's hardware to allow testing of the UI, for example.

If you are in production or are developing directly on Hector's Pi you should set this var to `False`.
